# Building a REST API with Spring Boot

## Introduction
This repository contains the source code for a RESTful API built using Spring Boot. The project is part of a Spring Academy course ([click here for more info](https://spring.academy/courses/building-a-rest-api-with-spring-boot)) that guides developers through the process of creating a fully functional, secure, and well-tested API for a Family Cash Card application.

## About the Project

Family Cash Card application â€” a modern way for parents to manage allowance funds for their kiddos.

Parents often find themselves lacking an easy way to manage (i.e. send, receive, track) allowances for their kids. So instead of handing out a stack of bills, our cloud-based Family Cash Card app allows parents to virtually manage "cash cards" for their kiddos. You can think of the cash card being very similar to a gift card that many of us send and receive. The primary goal of the Family Cash Card app is to give parents ease and control over managing funds for their children.

You'll use Spring Boot to progress from creating a single cash card in a database to allowing for the editing, deleting, and viewing of multiple cash cards, and finally securing your app against unauthorized access and unwanted exploits.
